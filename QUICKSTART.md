# Finding Your Next Job with Claude

You've got a new helper for your job search. Here's how to use it.

---

## Getting Started

The first time, Claude needs to get to know you. Just open a chat and say something like:

> "Hey, I want to start looking for a new job. Can you help me set up?"

Claude will have a conversation with you — maybe 20-30 minutes — asking about:

- What you do now and what you've done before
- Your proudest achievements (the stories you'd tell in an interview)
- What kind of job you're looking for
- What you definitely DON'T want
- Where you'd be willing to work
- How much you need to earn

Be honest and specific. The more Claude knows, the better it can help you later. Think of it like briefing a really good recruiter friend.

## Once You're Set Up

### Looking for jobs

Just tell Claude what you're after:

> "Find me marketing jobs in Berlin"

> "What's out there for project managers? Remote would be nice."

> "Search for anything interesting in tech, posted this week"

Claude will go look, throw out the obvious bad fits, and show you what's worth your time.

### When something catches your eye

> "Tell me more about this one"

> "What's this company actually like?"

> "Would this be a good fit for me?"

Claude will dig into the company — funding, product, culture, red flags — and tell you honestly whether it matches what you said you wanted.

### Ready to apply

> "Help me apply to this"

> "Can you adjust my CV for this role?"

> "Write me a cover letter"

Claude will tailor everything to the specific job, highlighting the parts of your experience that matter most for that role.

### Before an interview

> "I have an interview with [Company] next week. Help me prepare."

> "What should I tell them about myself?"

> "What should I ask them?"

Claude will pick the right stories from your profile and prep you for what they'll probably ask.

## A Few Tips

**During setup, be real.** If you hated your last job, say why. If you bombed an interview once, share what happened. Claude uses all of this to help you — not to judge you.

**After interviews, check in.** If something surprised you in an interview — a question you fumbled, a red flag you noticed — tell Claude. It'll remember for next time.

**If Claude says something's not a fit, ask why.** It's comparing the job to what YOU told it you wanted. Sometimes it's right, sometimes your preferences have changed. Either way, it's a good conversation.

**Ask where info came from.** When Claude tells you about a company, it should be able to show you the source. If it can't, push back: "Where did you read that?"

## If Things Feel Off

**Claude seems to have forgotten who you are:**
> "Can you check my profile again?"

**Advice feels too generic:**
> "Look at my preferences before answering"

**It's filtering out jobs you actually want:**
> "Update my preferences — I've changed my mind about [whatever]"

## Your Data

Everything Claude learns about you stays on your computer. Your profile, your job research, your applications — it's all yours, stored locally. Nothing goes to some company's server.

Good luck with the search.

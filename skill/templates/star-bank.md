2. **Speed/execution:** Tell me about a time you shipped something fast.
3. **Scale/growth:** Have you driven measurable growth? Users, revenue, efficiency?
4. **Failure/learning:** Tell me about a time something didn't work out.
5. **Leadership:** When did you lead a team or initiative through difficulty?
